This dietory contains the resources to run unit tests on the API of the system.
The tests use ava.js, an API testing library. https://github.com/avajs/ava

Tests are run sequentially, with all fetch tests being run before post tests.
Each time before testing, developers should run db.sql in the root directory 
to re-make the database so that test data is still valid.
